Types, Typeof, String types, Boolean types, Object types, Array types, Tuple types, Enum types, Any types, Union types, Literal types, Function Types, Void Types, Interfaces, Modules Classes, Compiling

# Why this course rocks
Do you have a handle on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and are you wondering where to go next? Do you notice plenty of job ads mentioning TypeScript and wonder what they're about? Do you want to learn a programming language that is easy to read and debug?

If you answer YES to any of the above questions, then this is the course for you.

What will this course do for me? Learn TypeScript breaks down everything you need to get started using TypeScript into approachable chunks, to be consumed at your own pace and convenience. Throughout four sections, we'll cover primitive data types, structural data types, file organization, modules, classes, compiling, and more!

Even better, you'll be in build mode from the very beginning. Instead of long, theoretical lessons, you are launched straight into solving challenges and building a real-world style app.

This course is learning by doing, all the way! This practical approach ensures that your new knowledge sticks with you, and gives you the muscle memory you need to become an effective TypeScript developer.

What will I build? By the end of this course, you'll have built a fun, real-world-style couchsurfing site with loads of cool features like an expandable review section, a personalized welcome message, and a weather display in the footer.

Best of all, there's plenty of scope to expand or customize your project, so your TypeScript learning journey doesn't have to end when the course does!

Is there any support during the course? While we can't offer one-to-one support (yet!), our friendly Discord community is waiting to welcome your questions, share ideas with you, or just chat on a coffee break. We even have a dedicated TypeScript help channel!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
